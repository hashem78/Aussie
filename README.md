# Aussie

Aussie originally started as a submission for a competition hosted by the Australian embassy in Jordan with partnership from the Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), now I plan to continue working on Aussie as a pet project to perhaps one day distribute it on platform app stores.

# The Idea

One day I was just sitting outside in my yard and thought about the reasons why a big portion of the population tend to stay relatively close to the places they were born in and it hit me; people are lazy, plain and simple, give the ability to be so of course.
You see... often times things like travel and tourisim are thought to be luxuries, these luxuries might not be *that* expensive but their certainly uncomforting, wether it be financially, psychologically or even culturaly, most of time it's the travel anxiety and unceratinty that holds a person from going on a long deserved/dreamt of trip. 

I started Aussie with the end goal being, that is if I win the competition, the ease of travel to Australia,  so easy that your 90 yo granny would have to only do a couple of taps.

# Features
The list of features is quite good IMO, I'll try to list the ones that are on the top of my head, I hope I don't forget any major ones...
- Cross platform
  - Through dart/Flutter this app will support various different user platforms, for now Android and IOS though and even the latter is still in early dev cycle.
- Ease of Use.
- Support for Arabic/English loclizations.
- Support for dark mode.
